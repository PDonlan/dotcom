### Modern Data Base Collection Methods

The Mysticetus database design is a powerful feature that spans across your data collection methods – from predefining the data, to collection and verification, then closing with accurate reports. For example:

* It allows for definition of common data types and formats for data collection leveraging predefined data and terms that are used for sightings, conditions, and events.
* GPS and time data are automatically inserted (never forgotten, mistyped, or guessed at) with every recorded event.
* Position over time is constantly recorded and updated for each workstation assuring common situational representation of the mission in all modes: History, current state, predicted positions.
* A photograph can be inserted by the MMO and tied to a point in time representing an specific event.
* [Report generation](/feature/reporting/) becomes very simple to define and generated in seconds versus hours. Reports are readily repeatable, consistent, and publication ready.
* Replay functionality allows revisiting a survey during any point of time in the past through a single click. This creates the situational map at that time which allows for

##### Data collection is predefined to assure data completeness, clarity, and operational phase are known.

Common formats for data collection and identification removes post data collection pain of interpreting the ambiguity of MMO shorthand which can vary from observer to observer. Prior to the start of an operation an observation template can be created predefining major fields required, animal names to be used including shorthand reference, operational modes defined such as transit versus survey, and required data for a sighting. This assures that come time for report generation collected data is complete and correct with shorthand ambiguity eliminated. As a plus, operational training is simplified!

_Animal IDs are predefined_

##### Mysticetus database design supports QA/QC with a large number of features targeting QA/QC visualization and automatic data editing including:

* The ability to assign imported GPX tracklines to any vehicle/station and move its sightings accordingly based on time of sighting.
* Post-process updates to theodolite sightings can be made to address effective eye height changes based on tides (i.e. you can incorporate tide changes at some point after you gather the data).
* Re-center the map on any sighting in the sighting table. This allows you to zoom directly to an animal on the map. Simply right click on the sighting record in the entry sheet and choose “Show on Map”.

_Review single data points_

##### Related features in Mysticetus further add to QA capability such as the predicted position points feature.

For example, the screen below predicts the motion of a sighting two minutes into the future. The dashed line represents how Mysticetus predicts the motion of the animal. In this case, a sighting ID was incorrectly repeated during data entry of an observation leading to a velocity of thousands of kilometers per hour. Clearly something is wrong.

Pointing at the end of the prediction point tells the editor exactly which animal this happened to (sighting at 2014-09-17 0958 PDT). The editor can then fix this obvious data problem with ease.
