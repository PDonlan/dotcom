						<h2>Mysticetus Automatic Report Generation saves you time while eliminating frustration!</h2>
						<p class="lead">Report generation is an expensive, time consuming process which ties up precious resources</p>
						<p>Report creation is a lengthy process spanning across multiple teams. There is a time tax ($’s!) in not just the obvious data recording, but then data interpretation (short hand notes anyone?), data movement between programs, data consolidation between observers and days, quality control, GIS team contributions, and then final report generation. This demands additional expensive hours of labor in generating the required reports.</p>
						<p>Now NMFS has started to require weekly reports of estimated take. This involves multiplying animal population polygons against theoretical size of ensonified regions of seismic, based on actual tracklines that were covered that week. This requires GIS people to do a bunch of work, hence turning around reports in the required time is often challenging.</p>
						<p class="lead">Mysticetus automates the report generation process</p>
						<p>With Mysticetus automatic report generation – Reports are generated with essentially the press of a single button. Reports created are publish ready. Report generation can also assist quality assurance efforts – fear not, bad data! Simply fix, regenerate and stop pulling your hair out.</p>
						<p>Mysticetus’s report generation feature also eliminates dependencies on expensive GIS services during post processing in most cases.</p>
